Subject: 2016ff file locations for visibility plots

Hi Barron,

Here are the locations of all of the files you need to create the visibility stacked barplots for the 2016ff simulations.  Thank you for your help!

On atmos:
CAMx daily IOAPI files: /work/romo/users/shn/2016eval/PM_CAMx/
CMAQ daily IOAPI files: /work/romo/users/shn/2016eval/PM_CMAQ/

On G:
Observation file with impaired days and all relevant parameters: G:\SHARE\MATS\AQAG Inputs 2018\ClassIareas_NEWIMPROVEALG_2000to2017_2019_feb11_IMPAIRMENT.csv

Also as a bonus, if you want to look at any of the evaluation plots on G they are available at: G:\SHARE\AQMG_Projects\Model Evaluation\2016beta_eval

Thanks,
Heather
